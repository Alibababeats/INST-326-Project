# INST 326 Project
A Screensaver that has a date, time, motivational quotes, and a moveable character that you can control or have follow your mouse

Each day there is a new quote and a different screen

The user will have an option to control the character with the arrow keys up, down, left, and right, or they can have the character follow the mouse. 

We will be importing the pygame module to assist with movements and displaying a screen.
