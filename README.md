# INST 326 Project
A Screensaver that has a date, time, motivational quotes, and a moveable character that you can control.

The background fades, and the quotes change every hour

The user will have an option to control the character with the arrow keys up, down, left, and right. 

We will be importing the pygame, pandas, and datetime modules to assist with movements and displaying a screen.

HOW TO USE
TOGGLE FULLSCREEN: Press "f" on the keyboard to toggle between fullscreen and windowed
QUIT: Press "esc"
MOVE CHARACTER: Arrow keys
